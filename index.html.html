<h3 style="font-family:courier;">What is an Ecosystem?</h3>
<p>The ecosystem is the structural and functional unit of ecology 
where the living organisms interact with each other and the surrounding environment. 
In other words, an ecosystem is a chain of interaction between organisms and their environment. The term “Ecosystem” was 
first coined by A.G.Tansley, an English botanist, in 1935.
Read on to explore the structure, components, types and 
functions of the ecosystem.</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Types of Ecosystem</h3>
<p>An ecosystem can be as small as an oasis in a desert, or as big as an ocean, spanning thousands of miles. There are two types of ecosystem:</p>
<p>⋅Terrestrial Ecosystem</p>
<p>⋅Aquatic Ecosystem</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Terrestrial Ecosystems</h3>
<p>Terrestrial ecosystems are exclusively land-based ecosystems. There are different types of terrestrial ecosystems distributed around various geological zones. They are as follows:</p>
<p>1.Forest Ecosystems</p>
<p>2.Grassland Ecosystems</p>
<p>3.Tundra Ecosystems</p>
<p>4.Desert Ecosystem</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Aquatic Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Aquatic ecosystems are ecosystems present in a body of water. These can be further divided into two types, namely:</p>
<p>1.Freshwater Ecosystem</p>
<p>2.Marine Ecosystem</p>

</center>


<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Structure of the Ecosystem</h3>
<p>The structure of an ecosystem is characterised by the organisation of both biotic and abiotic components. This includes the distribution of energy in our environment. It also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment. 
The structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely:</p>
<p>⋅Biotic Components</p>
<p>⋅Abiotic Components</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Biotic Components</h3>
<p>Biotic components refer to all life in an ecosystem.  Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorised into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).</p>
<p>⋅Producers include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.</p>
<p>⋅Consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.</p>
   <p>⋅Primary consumers are always herbivores that they rely on producers for food.</p>
   <p>⋅Secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be a carnivore or an omnivore.</p>
   <p>⋅Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food.  Tertiary consumers can also be an omnivore.</p>
<p>⋅Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter.  Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.</p>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Abiotic Components</h3>
<p>Abiotic components are the non-living component of an ecosystem.  It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Parts of Speech</h1>
<a name="Parts of Speech"></a>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">What are the Parts of Speech?</h3>
<p>The parts of speech explain how a word is used in a sentence. 
There are eight main parts of speech (also known as word classes): nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.
Most parts of speech can be divided into sub-classes. Prepositions can be divided into prepositions of time, prepositions of place etc. Nouns can be divided into proper nouns, common nouns, concrete nouns etc.</p>

<a name="Roman and Greek Civilization"></a>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">(Greek Civilization)</h3>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">History:</h3>
<p>⋅The Greeks are the first ancient society with which modern society feels an immediate affinity. We can identify with Greek art, Greek politics, Greek curiosity, and the Greek sense of history. The polis, roughly translated as the city-state, was the prevailing social and political unit of ancient Greece. 
Athens and Sparta were the two most significant poleis.</p>
<p><iframe width="420"height="315"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bDrYTXQLu8"></iframe></p> 

<p>⋅Sparta was a conservative military oligarchy ruled jointly by two kings and a council of elders. It had an excellent army, but its society was highly regimented. Sparta produced little of artistic or cultural importance.</p>

</center>

<p>⋅Athens progressed from an old-fashioned, aristocratic tribal state in the eighth century B.C. to a tyranny and then to a democracy by the fifth century B.C. 
Among the most important leaders of this transition from a state based on ties of kinship to one based on political citizenship were the lawgivers Draco and Solon, the tyrant Pisistratus, and the reformer Cleisthenes.</p>
<p>⋅Athens depended, as did all Greek states, upon the systematic exploitation of slaves. Although influential in the home, women were also a subject group. Fathers and husbands determined the extent of their personal freedom.</p>

<body>

</center>

<p>⋅By the fifth century B.C., the Persian Empire, which had subjugated all of the Near East, including the Greek cities of Asia Minor (Ionia), was extending its rule into northern Greece. 
Two Persian invasions of Greece were defeated: by the Athenians at Marathon (490 B.C.) and by united Greek forces at the battles of Salamis (480) and Plataea (479).</p>
<p>⋅After the defeat of Persia, Athens and Sparta were rivals for the leadership of Greece. The Athenian Empire that emerged from the Persian defeat was brought to its zenith by Pericles, who beautified Athens and advanced the democratization of its constitution.
Rivalry between Athens and Sparta led to the Peloponnesian Wars (460-445, 431-404 B.C.), in which Athens was eventually defeated after a plague ravaged the city and a great expedition to Sicily met with disaster.</p>
<p>⋅Thereafter, neither Sparta, nor Thebes, nor a revived Athens, could successfully lead Greece. In the 330s Greek disunity led to domination by Philip, king of Macedon, a semi-Greek kingdom to the north.</p>

</center>

<p>⋅Philip’s son Alexander, the Great, invaded and conquered the Persian Empire in 334-327 B.C. Alexander’s conquests spread Greek colonists and culture from Egypt to the borders of India.
After Alexander’s death in 323 three main successor dynasties emerged, each founded by one of his generals: the Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids in Syria and Mesopotamia, and the Antigonids in Macedon and Asia Minor. All of these states were eventually absorbed by Rome.</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Contributions:</h3>
<p>⋅Greek religion was centered upon the worship of the Olympian gods. Greek drama developed out of a festival at Athens in honor of the god Dionysus. The chief Greek playwrights who have survived are the tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides and the comic writers Aristophanes and Menander. 
The principal Greek historians whose work has come down to us are Herodotus, who wrote about the Persian Wars; Thucydides, the historian of the Peloponnesian Wars; and Polybius, whose subject was the rise of Roman power.</p>
<p><iframe width="420"height="315"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W0MuOH0_b8"></iframe></p> 

<p>⋅The Greeks attributed many of the workings of nature to natural rather than to supernatural causes. In medicine, geography, geometry, physics, and astronomy, their achievements still command respect.</p>

</center>

<p>⋅Greek philosophy had its roots in natural science and in the tendency of science to question established beliefs and traditions. 
Socrates taught that the truth could be found only in a never-ending debate, a process of question and answer-the famous “Socratic method.” 
His pupil Plato’s theory of Ideas is one of the great wellsprings of Western thought. 
Plato’s pupil Aristotle was the first to use scientific method, classifying living things, beliefs, and systems of government. 
The Epicurean and Stoic schools of philosophy sought to show people how to live contented lives in a troubled world. 
The influence of Greek art and architecture on Western civilization is incalculable.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">(Roman Civilization)</h3>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">History:</h3>
<p>The history of the Roman Empire can be divided into three distinct periods: The Period of Kings (625-510 BC), Republican Rome (510-31 BC), and Imperial Rome (31 BC – AD 476).
<p>⋅Roman Republic (510 BC – 40 BC)</p>
<p>⋅Imperial Rome (20 AD - 360 AD)</p>
<p>⋅Eastern Roman Empire (405 AD – 1453 AD)</p>
<p>⋅Western Roman Empire (405 AD – 480 AD)</p>
<p><iframe width="420"height="315"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXoEpNjgKzg"></iframe></p> 

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Founding (c. 625 BC):</h4>
<p>⋅Rome was founded around 625 BC in the areas of ancient Italy known as Etruria and Latium. 
It is thought that the city-state of Rome was initially formed by Latium villagers joining together with settlers from the surrounding hills in response to an Etruscan invasion. 
It is unclear whether they came together in defense or as a result of being brought under Etruscan rule. 
Archaeological evidence indicates that a great deal of change and unification took place around 600 BC which likely led to the establishment of Rome as a true city.</p>

</center>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Period of Kings (625-510 BC):</h4>
<p>⋅The first period in Roman history is known as the Period of Kings, and it lasted from Rome’s founding until 510 BC. 
During this brief time Rome, led by no fewer than six kings, advanced both militaristically and economically with increases in physical boundaries, 
military might, and production and trade of goods including oil lamps. Politically, this period saw the early formation of the Roman constitution. 
The end of the Period of Kings came with the decline of Etruscan power, thus ushering in Rome’s Republican Period.</p>

</center>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Republican Rome (510-31 BC):</h4>
<p>⋅Rome entered its Republican Period in 510 BC. No longer ruled by kings, 
the Romans established a new form of government whereby the upper classes ruled, namely the senators and 
the equestrians, or knights. However, a dictator could be nominated in times of crisis. 
In 451 BC, the Romans established the “Twelve Tables,” a standardized code of laws meant for public, private, and political matters.</p>
<p>⋅Rome continued to expand through the Republican Period and gained control over the entire Italian peninsula by 338 BC. It was the Punic Wars from 264-146 BC, 
along with some conflicts with Greece, that allowed Rome to take control of Carthage and Corinth and thus become the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean.</p>

</center>
<p>⋅Soon after, Rome’s political atmosphere pushed the Republic into a period of chaos and civil war. This led to the election of a dictator, L. Cornelius Sulla, 
who served from 82-80 BC. Following Sulla’s resignation in 79 BC, the Republic returned to a state of unrest. 
While Rome continued to be governed as a Republic for another 50 years, the shift to Imperialism began to materialize in 60 BC when Julius Caesar rose to power.</p>
<p>⋅By 51 BC, Julius Caesar had conquered Celtic Gaul and, for the first time, Rome’s borders had spread beyond the Mediterranean region. Although the Senate was still Rome’s governing body, 
its power was weakening. Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and replaced by his heir, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (Octavian) who ruled alongside Mark Antony. 
In 31 BC Rome overtook Egypt which resulted in the death of Mark Antony and left Octavian as the unchallenged ruler of Rome. Octavian assumed the title of Augustus and thus became the first emperor of Rome.</p>

</center>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Imperial Rome (31 BC – AD 476):</h4>
<p>⋅Rome’s Imperial Period was its last, beginning with the rise of Rome’s first emperor in 31 BC and lasting until the fall of Rome in AD 476. 
During this period, Rome saw several decades of peace, prosperity, and expansion. 
By AD 117, the Roman Empire had reached its maximum extant, spanning three continents including Asia Minor, northern Africa, and most of Europe.</p>
<p>⋅In AD 286 the Roman Empire was split into eastern and western empires, each ruled by its own emperor. The western empire suffered several Gothic invasions and, in AD 455, was sacked by Vandals. 
Rome continued to decline after that until AD 476 when the western Roman Empire came to an end. The eastern Roman Empire, more commonly known as the Byzantine Empire, survived until the 15th century AD. 
It fell when Turks took control of its capital city, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul in Turkey) in AD 1453.</p>

<p>⋅Ancient Romans were very advanced for their time, learning of easier ways to deal with situations and advancing technology and medicine. Some of the Romans’ 
most well-known contributions to society were their welfare programs for the poor, irrigation systems, law and politics, and even concrete.
At first, welfare was nothing more than a requirement for the Roman government to supply the people with small percentages of grain, but moved along to add corn, oil, bread, pork, wine, and clothing(via Contonental E.</p>

</center>
<p>⋅Ancient Roman irrigation is most popularly known for the aqueducts which they constructed. Aqueducts used bridges in order to transport water to cities near the ocean. 
From the ocean there was a passage leading into a river or lake and the Romans found that by using bridges to lead the water inwards and over deep grooves in the land, 
they could harness the water for their own use</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Linear equations:</h3>
<p>⋅A linear function is one of the form y = mx + c. For each input of x, you get one output for y. The graph of these functions is a single straight line. </p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">How do you draw a graph of a linear function?</h3>
<p>⋅Regardless of whether a table is given to you, you should consider using one to ensure you’re correctly graphing linear and quadratic functions. 

For example,</p>
<p>⋅Plot the graph of y = 2x – 1 for -3 ≤ x ≤ 3. </p>
<p>⋅This inequality notation means that we should plot the graph for values of x between and including -3 and 3. </p>
<p>⋅A table of values might look as below. Note that if a table of values isn’t given, you can get away with calculating no less than 3 coordinates for a linear function. You might wish to just choose positive values of x for ease!</p>
<p>x	-3	-2	-1	0	1	2	3 </p>
<p>y</p>
<p>⋅To find the relevant values for y, substitute the value of x into the equation y = 2x – 1.</p>
<p>⋅When x = -3, y = 2 × (-3) – 1 = -7.</p>
<p>⋅When x = -2, y = 2 × (-2) – 1 = -5.</p>
<p>⋅When x = -1, y = 2 × (-1) – 1 = -3.</p>
<p>⋅The finished table will look like this:</p>

<p>x	-3	-2	-1	0	1	2	3</p>
<p>y	-7	-5	-3	-1	1	3	5</p>
<p>⋅These values are ready to be plotted on a graph. Don’t forget to join them up with a straight line!</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Quadratic equations:</h3>
<p>⋅A quadratic function is one of the form y = ax2 + bx + c. For each output for y, there can be up to two associated input values of x. The graph of these functions is a parabola – a smooth, approximately u-shaped or n-shaped, curve. </p>
<body>

</center>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">How do you draw a graph of a quadratic function?</h3>
<p>⋅You will be given a table to complete. Once again, to find the values for y, substitute the values of x into the equation given.
For example,</p>
<p>⋅Complete the table of values for the function y = x2 + x – 2.</p>
<p>x	-3	-2	-1	0	1	2</p>
<p>y	4	 	 	-2	</p>

<p>⋅Remember to be really careful when working with quadratics. We must remember that when we square a negative number, we get a positive result. </p>
<p>⋅When x = -2, y = (-2)2 + (-2) – 2 = </p>
<p>⋅When x = -1, y = (-1)2 + (-1) – 2 = -2</p>
<p>⋅When x = 1, y = 12 + 1 – 2 = 0</p>
<p>⋅When x = 2, y = 22 + 2 – 2 = 4</p>
<p>⋅The finished table is:</p>
<p>⋅x	-3	-2	-1	0	1	2</p>
<p>⋅y	4	0	-2	-2	0	4</p>
<p>⋅Quadratic graphs are symmetrical, so the symmetry in our coordinates is a good indication that we’ve calculated these values correctly. </p>
<p>⋅These values are ready to be plotted on a graph. Don’t forget to join them up with a smooth curve!</p>

<h1 style="background-color:AliceBlue;">Team Sports</h1>
<a name="Team Sports"></a>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">(Team Sports)</h3>
<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">What is Team Sports?</h3>

<p>⋅A team sport includes any sport where individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. 
Team members act together towards a shared objective. This can be done in a number of ways such as outscoring the opposing team. 
Team members set goals, make decisions, communicate, manage conflict, and solve problems in a supportive, 
trusting atmosphere in order to accomplish their objectives. Examples are basketball, 
volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of association football and hockey.</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">List of Team Sports</h3>

<h4>1.) American Gridiron Football</h4>
<p>⋅American football is a physical contact sport that includes 22 athletes on the field, 11 on each team, and up to 50-60 players on the roster. 
Football demands toughness, and the intensity of the game helps develop a strong bond between teammates. 
It is an exciting and physical sport that involves thorough communication between players on and off the field.</p>

<h4>2.) Baseball</h4>
<p>⋅Baseball involves two teams composed of nine starting players. However, only one team is on the field while the other team is at-bat at any given point in the game. Each team will switch from offense to defense every inning. 
Baseball is a slower-paced sport, with no actual game clock to track time restraints, and requires players to concentrate and have consistent performances. Every player has a role to play in the game, 
with each requiring a different set of skills and abilities.</p>

<h4>3.) Basketball</h4>
<p>⋅The sport of basketball is a quick and fast-paced game that involves thorough communication and unity between the players on the court. Each player must be able to shoot, 
pass, dribble, and have substantial endurance. It takes daily practice and patience in order to master this sport. 
Basketball features five players on the court for each team and requires constant communication, dedication to learning plays, and trust in your teammates to succeed.</p>

<h4>4.) Cricket</h4>
<p>⋅While cricket requires many of the same basic intangibles featured in other sports, such as teamwork and athleticism, there are also some notable differences in the way the sport is played. For example, in cricket, the sub can only be used when another player is injured during a game. 
The game involves 11 players on each team, and the twelfth member only participates when the umpire allows the sub to enter the field of play. To play cricket, the equipment you will need includes a cricket bat, padding, gloves, balls, helmets, stumps, and wickets. 
The goal of cricket is to score the most runs. The rules of cricket may take some time to grasp, but with practice, diligence, and hard work, cricket is an extremely engaging sport.</p>

<h4>5.) Handball</h4>
<p>⋅In handball, two teams of seven players face off on a court in a fast and mentally strategic game. While handball incorporates many attributes that other sports have, a goalie, defense, offense, 
and the goal of getting the ball into a net, it is unique in its skills and tactics. Each teammate is obligated to think quickly and have confidence in the players on the court with them. 
This game is easy to pick up but difficult to master. With time and diligence, players will have fun, build relationships, and create mental toughness that can be used in many aspects of life.</p>

<h4>6.) Ice Hockey</h4>
<p>⋅Ice hockey is a sport that originated in Canada and involves two teams trying to score goals on one another. Each team has five skaters and one goalie on the ice at a time. 
Players use a stick to pass and shoot a puck at the other team's net. 
Competitive ice hockey requires a fair amount of equipment, but can be played recreationally with simply a stick, skates and a puck.</p>

<h4>7.) Rugby</h4>
<p>⋅Rugby is a rough and aggressive sport that takes both confidence and fearlessness on the pitch. 
Rugby requires that players support one another and remain level-headed due to the passion that goes into playing this sport. 
This game requires rapid decision-making, strategic tackling, and intense practice in order for players to prepare for competition properly. 
The most important skills to hone for playing rugby are kicking, catching, tackling, and an overall knowledge of the game. 
Rugby features either seven or fifteen players on the pitch at any given time, with each having a unique set of skills and responsibilities. </p>

<h4>8.) Soccer (Association Football)</h4>
<p>⋅With 11 players on each team, soccer is a popular sport worldwide. 
It demands multi-tasking and leg coordination, while also being attentive to both your teammates and the opposition. 
Soccer uses minimal equipment, with only the ball and goals being essential. However, cleats, shin guards, and uniforms are required at organized levels of play. 
The main objective of the game is to get the ball in the goal. While the idea is simplistic, the execution takes intense practice and discipline. 
When playing soccer, players are guaranteed to learn teamwork, perseverance, endurance, and persistence.</p>

<h4>9.) Softball</h4>
<p>⋅Like baseball, softball is composed of nine players for each team and features an innings format instead of a game clock. 
However, softball uses a larger ball and requires that all pitchers throw underhand. 
Conventional softball fields also have shorter basepaths and the outfield fences are typically far closer to home plate, which can prove to be a substantial difference in regard to offensive play. 
Softball takes mental toughness, constant awareness on the field, and a keen knowledge of the strike zone when hitting.</p>

<h4>10.) Volleyball</h4>
<p>⋅Depending on the type of volleyball game, this sport can have anywhere from two to six players on the court for each team. 
This game involves quick decision making and constant attentiveness to all players on the court. 
It takes extreme hand-eye coordination and steady communication between teammates at all times.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:CadetBlue;">Reflection</h1>
<a name="Reflection"></a>

<p>Making this Project was very challenging for me. I needed to learn many concepts in HTML and CSS.
It was my first time making something like this. I started out struggling a lot for the first week.
I didn't know how to start a web page like this, so I just went with the motions.</p>

<p>The second week became more easier because I already knew what to do with my webpage. 
I learned more concepts like putting videos and pictures. I became more creative with making my project.
For the third and last week I learned so many concepts in HTML and even learned basic CSS. I learned how to make make
a menu bar and added my own background. </p>

<p>Even though this project was very hard I enjoyed it very much. It was so great putting our own creative input
in making this webpage. It was also fun learning basic and hard concepts in both HTML and CSS. I have learned so many things making this project, and I will bring the knowledge
I learned from making this project in the next school years.
